# Module34
BSM Engineering Euler Problem 5 + Test Driven Development

#This program is meant to solve Euler problem #5 and also test the functions to make sure they are working properly

#make sure all modules are in the same directory when you use them n\
#mult4code.py is just the equations for the answer n\
#mult4.py is the main file - USE THIS TO RUN THE PROGRAM n\
#autotest.py automatically tests the output of each function
#(You can change the formula in mult4code and then run autotest and it will show which function you changed...
#unless you changed something so drastically that the program will keep running forever and never find a solution)
#In check just switch around < and > for example and you will receive:
#Check Failed
#Expected output True, received output error
