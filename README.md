# Module34
BSM Engineering Euler Problem 5 + Test Driven Development

This program is meant to solve Euler problem #5 and also test the functions to make sure they are working properly

make sure all modules are in the same directory when you use them
mult4code.py is just the equations for the answer
mult4.py is the main file - USE THIS TO RUN THE PROGRAM
autotest.py automatically tests the output of each function
(You can change the formula in mult4code and then run autotest and it will show which function you changed...
unless you changed something so drastically that the program will keep running forever and never find a solution)
In check just switch around < and > for example and you will receive:
Check Failed
Expected output True, received output error

#This program is meant to solve Euler problem #5
#Plus test when it gets the wrong answer
#When you see a line that looks like

#that means it is the start of a new module
"""
Put each of the 3 modules into separate files within the same directory to use them
mult4code is just the numbers
mult4 is the main program
RUN mult4 TO USE IT
autotest is the module that tests the output of each function within mult4code
Try changing the math formula in mult4code and run autotest to see if it finds your mistake!
*if you change the formula too much you will probably not get an answer for a VERY long time*
I just switch around < and > signs lol
